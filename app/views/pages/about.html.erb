<h1>About US</h1>
<p>A birthday is one of the most important milestones of a person's year. It's a time to step forward and let your mother, your father, your sister or brother, or your friend or coworker know just how much they mean to you.</p>
<p>These days, Facebook and email make it easy to step forward and tell your loved ones how much you care...but maybe it's too easy. Even if we think of ourselves as thoughtful, caring people, we've all dashed off a "Happy Birthday!" to a near-stranger, out of a sense of digital obligation. It feels tiring to give birthday greetings like that, and even more draining to receive them -- and that's never how a birthday should feel.</p>
<p>We put together this site because we believe that birthdays should be special again. We want technological innovation to serve humanity and bring people together, rather than to place barriers between people and call it intimacy.</p>
<p>Our site asks you to write fifty words (or more) of birthday wishes to your loved one. Maybe that seems like a lot in our bustling digital age where we're used to trying to keep things brief, but we promise it's not. Once you start writing about what your loved one means to you, what you want for them in their lives, what your hopes for the coming year are ... you won't want to stop. You'll rediscover how good it feels to say good things.</p>
<p>We also give you the option of uploading a picture of your choice. It can be anything ranging from a funny picture of a cute animal to a memory of you and your friend together to something profound and inspirational. How you choose to uplift your friends and cheer them up on their special days is up to you.</p>
<p>So check your calendar. Who's birthday is coming up? Who means the most to you, and who do you want to show that you care? Set up an account on our website using Twitter or Facebook, get your friends in on what's happening and help us put meaning back into birthdays. Your friends might turn around in a few months and do the same for you. We promise: you'll never want to dash off another impersonal "Happy Birthday" again.</p>
